================

github convert of 
http://scanlime.org/2009/04/robot-odyssey-ds-first-screenshots/ 
http://svn.navi.cx/misc/trunk/robot-odyssey-ds/ 
Original code from http://scanlime.org/author/admin/

Note: I am not the original author of Robot Odyssey nor of this patch.

This patch set will not work without original Robot Odyssey code.

This copy was made without permission. However, as it has been sitting for a few years, 
I thought I'd try to do something else with the code. Please don't ask me how it works. 
I am looking for a modern interpretation of this classic game. I'm not a game programmer, 
so I don't know how that will pan out.

Maybe nothing. But at least there's a possibility that someone might run with this in the future.

Please keep credits. So far, I've only made this README.
